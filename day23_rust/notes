Part 2 was solved manually. Each computer had 13 outgoing connections, but by looking at the number of outgoing connections which are themselves connected together, we can get a heuristic for the likelyhood of being a large fully connected subgraph. In my case, there were at most 130 self-connections for a computer (counting duplicates). Filtering for 130 self-conenctions revealed a list which was clearly not a fully connected subgraph, however, the next highest at 121 did show a smaller list which did clearly show a fully connected subgraph of 12 nodes.
